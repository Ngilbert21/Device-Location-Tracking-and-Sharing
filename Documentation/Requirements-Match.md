### Medium Priority
- [ ] Media markers
  - Due to time constraints, the client decided this requirement was no longer necessary
### Low Priority
- [ ] External sources
  - Due to time constraints, the client decided this requirement was no longer necessary
## Non-functional requirements
### High Priority
- [X] Retained records (To an extent)
  - Trips are saved to the database, but the database has only one trip that gets overwritten upon saving
- [ ] Real time
  - We did not get to this requirement in time, as the majority of the other requirements had to be done before it
