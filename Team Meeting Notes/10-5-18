10/05/18 Meeting:
- Most of the meeting was devoted to discussing the prototypes, which will be included in a separate folder.
- Plan for next week is to look over the current app and get a feel for the flow of the design and a general view of how the application works
- Doing so will likely provide us with more questions for our project, which will be much of the content for the next meeting.
