10/21/2018 Notes
For most of this meeting, we discussed the basis for our UML diagram, how best to proceed with next week's meeting, and the colloquium that Nick attended.
We came up with a few possible classes for the diagram, which would be the user class, media class, route class, trip class, and group class.
We also discussed the possibility of the media class to have a subclass for each type, but we will decide that once we see how it is structured in the database.
We will be emailing Kyle soon to set up a time for our next client meeting, hopefully on Friday the 26th at 12:30, and we also have a few further questions for him.
However, most of the meeting will consist of us presenting our work.
For the colloquium, a few interesting points were made. We believed that the fact that they had to recreate a tool that has already been 
built from scratch and found it difficult was relevant to us, because the first part of our project will likely be to recreate
the pre-existing functionality of the Traveler app. It was also enlightening to see how an actual company deals with its clients, and we learned
some about time management that we believe will be helpful in our project.
