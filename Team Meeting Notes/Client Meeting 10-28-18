Client Meeting: 10/28/18 12:30pm in BC182
This week was our meeting with our client. The bulk of the notes will be uploaded soon, but here are my notes that I took on the side.
- While the application stores its information in GeoJSON format, that information stays as lat/long/bearing/etc. information while the tour is still occurring.
- In case of user-to-user desync, it would be a good idea to implement some kind of "exponential backoff" logic so that the application isn't constantly trying to reconnect if doing so is impossible.
- A user should be able to toggle on or off which other users' paths they want to see.
- The ability to do as mentioned above, or to see another user's shared media, should be allowed or denied based on the submitting user.
We also clarified some terminology with the client, and set a standard monthly meeting time for the second-to-last Friday of the month, at 12:30pm in his office.
- The SKD has been updated to SKD 16
- Syncing should always be open so people may join or leave at any time
- Locations updatesshoudl be done both ways, individual and group wise
- Notify users if their network connection is broken
- Locations sharing is optional but would be nice
