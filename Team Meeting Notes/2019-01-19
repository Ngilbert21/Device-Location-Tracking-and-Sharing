During this meeting we discuss what needs to be done on the project and how we will divide the labor.
Following this we discussed how to implement the various parts of our project along with what we want to focus on for the timebeing.
We have decided to focus on getting basic functionality to the system, this includes a way to sign in, along with a very basic location tracker.
