10-25-18 meeting notes
During this meeting we mainly went over our previous work.
This includes the requirements sheet, and usecases which were one of the main focuses of the meeting. 
We had set these as a proority as we had an upcoming client meeting with Kyle and wanted to have everything preped and ready to go over with him.
Along with the previously stated items we created a prototype to show kyle and hear his feedback.
