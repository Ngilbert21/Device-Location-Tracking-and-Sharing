This week, we split up the responsibilities for creating our functional prototype and began work on it. The overall tasks we have for the prototype are UI, registration and login, and creating and editing teams. The registration system will be using username and password to start, and the prototype will mostly be for the purpose of showing how the app will flow. We are also currently trying to change the date of our monthly meeting to next Wednesday due to Thanksgiving Break.
