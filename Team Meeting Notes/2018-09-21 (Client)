Client Meeting: 09/21/18 12pm in BC182

- Our project will be a proof of concept for additional functionality for an already-developed app by 14Eleven called The Traveler
- The Traveler allows people on tours to track their routes, as well as collect media and geotag them along those routes
- Part of the project is for us to discover the best way of performing the task ourselves, but we were restricted to Java/Swift and working with Azure
- The intervals for real-time sharing should be a setting, but will default to every 5 seconds
- Another goal is to upload the data as GeoJSON data real-time, instead of uploading at the end, which the app does now.
- Max group size to start will be 5 or 6, but should be scaleable up to 20
- Find a way to avoid recording data while the user is inactive (standing still)
- Possible shareable media includes pictures, videos, audio clips, and notes
- Project will be done in Android first, and if time allows, will be done in iOS as well. iOS is not mandatory to complete
- We will most likely be using the Azure blob, as that is where the current GeoJSON data and shared media is stored
- Kyle is willing to provide the schema for the database and the key for the in-app purchases for the Traveler

- Meeting times:
-- In class Tues and Thurs
-- Generally free friday at noon or 12:30
-- Keep in contact with scope of feasible work
