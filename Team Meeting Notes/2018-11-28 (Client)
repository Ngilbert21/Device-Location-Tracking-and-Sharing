During this meeting with Kyle we showed him our current prototype and explained our thoughts on the project.
After our presentation, we discussed more on the database schema, how it should be implemented and what we will need to do with it.
Along with this discussion Kyle informed us that when forming travel groups we maybe able to use Firebase instead of Azure for sending user invitations.
