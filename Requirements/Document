Device Location Tracking and Sharing
Requirements Document

-Project Description
--The Device Location Tracking and Sharing app is a proof of concept for 14Eleven Developmentâ€™s current app, The Traveler. While The Traveler allows users to track their routes and geo-mapped media markers, our app will allow users to sync their routes with other users that share a pre-defined group with them.
